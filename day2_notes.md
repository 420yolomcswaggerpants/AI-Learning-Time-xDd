# Day 2 Progress: From Script to Deployed AI Apps

## What I accomplished:
- Built a Python script that generates custom cold emails using the DeepSeek API.
- Created an interactive UI inside Google Colab using built-in forms.
- Wrote a prototype script that scrapes website content and asks the AI to analyze the audience.
- Transformed the Colab prototype into a real web app using Streamlit.
- Deployed the email generator to the public internet via Streamlit Cloud.
- Built a second app: an AI customer support agent with memory, rules, and FAQ buttons.
- Gave the support agent the ability to read a real FAQ document (RAG).
- Deployed the support agent to the public internet.

## Live Demos:
- Email Generator: https://ai-email-generator-420yolomcswaggerpants.streamlit.app
- Support Agent: https://support-agent-420yolomcswaggerpants.streamlit.app

## Skills learned:
- API chaining
- Prompt engineering (System prompts vs User prompts)
- Passing variables into prompts (f-strings)
- Basic web scraping with the `requests` library
- Using `temperature` and `max_tokens` to control AI output
- Building web apps with Streamlit
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Deploying to Streamlit Cloud
- Protecting API keys with .gitignore and secrets.toml
- Managing dependencies with requirements.txt
- Implementing memory in AI apps with st.session_state
- Creating quick-reply FAQ buttons
- Reading local files (faq.txt) and injecting them into prompts
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Errors I hit and fixed:
- Git not recognized (fixed by installing Git)
- Author identity unknown (fixed by configuring git user)
- GitHub push protection blocked my API key (fixed with .gitignore)
- Streamlit ModuleNotFoundError (fixed with requirements.txt)
- Frozen terminal during git push (fixed with direct URL push)
- Repository not found (fixed by creating repo on GitHub first)
- SyntaxError on SYSTEM_PROMPT (fixed by moving file reading block)
- NameError: FAQ_DATA not defined (fixed by defining it before use)
- StreamlitSecretNotFoundError (fixed by placing secrets.toml in .streamlit folder)

## Next steps:
- Add PDF upload capability so users can upload any document
- Fine-tune a model on custom data
- Add user authentication
- Monetize or showcase for job applications
