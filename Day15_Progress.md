# Day 15 Progress: MNIST Classifier From Scratch

## What I Did Today

### Concept Quiz (Separate Chat)
- Quizzed on Day 14 concepts (chunked session)

### Project 19: MNIST Classifier From Scratch
- Built 3-layer neural network in pure NumPy
- Architecture: 784 → 128 (ReLU) → 64 (ReLU) → 10 (softmax)
- Trained on 60,000 handwritten digit images
- Achieved 95.31% test accuracy on 10,000 unseen images
- Pushed to GitHub

### Training Results

| Epoch | Loss |
|-------|------|
| 0 | 0.796 |
| 2 | 0.300 |
| 4 | 0.239 |
| 6 | 0.201 |
| 8 | 0.175 |
| 9 | 0.164 |

### Test Accuracy: 95.31%

### Comparison Context
- Random guessing: 10%
- Simple ML models: 90-92%
- My from-scratch network: 95.31%
- State-of-the-art: 99%+

### Key Concepts Used
- Softmax for multi-class output
- Cross-entropy loss (multi-class version)
- One-hot encoding for labels
- Minibatch training (batch size 64) with shuffling
- Input normalization (pixels / 255.0)
- He initialization for ReLU
- Backpropagation through 3 layers

### New Concepts Added to Rotation
- Softmax
- One-hot encoding
- Multi-class cross-entropy
- Image normalization (pixels to [0,1])

## What I Learned

1. Softmax converts 10 raw outputs to probabilities summing to 1
2. One-hot encoding lets cross-entropy compare distributions directly
3. Minibatch with shuffling improves training stability
4. Input normalization is critical for image data
5. A from-scratch NumPy network can hit 95% on real data
